# express-skeleton
When I start a development of a "Minimum Viable Product" orientend to web using node.js I always start doing the same things:

- [x] Installing Express.js
- [x] Add MongoDB query string
- [x] Structure directories Routes, Controllers, Views and Libs
- [x] Add Bootstrap, jquery, Angular, etc
- [x] Install some security modules (helmet for Headers)
- [x] Add a basic bootstrap template with header, footer, menubar, etc
- [x] Log-in for local users with Passportjs
- [x] enable/disable facebook login and register
- [x] Log-in for facebook users with Passportjs
- [x] i18n
- [x] Geoip Language
- [x] Core e-mails
- [x] Local Register
- [x] Contact form
- [ ] My account
- [ ] Local Register Confirmation enable/disable
- [ ] Forgot Password


So I decide to create a repo with all this things ready to go.

(working in progress...)
