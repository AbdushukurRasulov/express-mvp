# express-skeleton
When I start a development of a "Minimum Viable Product" orientend to web using node.js I always start doing the same things:

- Installing Express.js
- Add MongoDB query string
- Structure directories Routes, Controllers, Views and Libs
- Add Bootstrap, jquery, Angular, etc
- Install some security modules (helmet for Headers)
- Add a basic bootstrap template with header, footer, menubar, etc
- Log-in for users with Passportjs
- Register
- Forgot Password
- Contact form
- etc...

So I decide to create a repo with all this things ready to go.

(working in progress...)
